# Data on HPC schedulers

What's the most popular HPC scheduler?  I asked this question on twitter https://twitter.com/walkingrandomly/status/1254004819490201600 and started collating the data here.  

It's very incomplete and PRs are welcome.  
* Ideally there should be a link to system documentation showing evidence that a system uses foo or bar.
* If you think there should be different fields in the CSV files, create an issue
* I'm not sure how to deal with dates.  For now I am just thinking about live systems.

## Current Top 500 systems

* [Top500.csv](./top500.csv)

## University Systems

* [Academic.csv](./Academic.csv)

## Other systems

Not in the Top 500 and not a University system.

* [other.csv](./other.csv)

## The schedulers
